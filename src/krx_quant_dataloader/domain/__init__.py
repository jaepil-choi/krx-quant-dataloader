"""
Domain layer

Purpose:
- Define core typed row aliases and simple value objects used across transforms and pipelines.
- Centralize the error taxonomy used by user-facing and raw layers.

This package contains zero network IO and no configuration parsing.
Other layers (transforms, pipelines, apis) may import from here.
