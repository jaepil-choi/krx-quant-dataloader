"""
Validation utilities (lightweight)

Status: PLACEHOLDER (not yet implemented)

Purpose:
- Simple row-level checks for presence of critical keys before preprocessing/shaping.
- Example: assert MDCSTAT01602 rows contain ISU_SRT_CD, BAS_PRC, TDD_CLSPRC.
- Raise clear, actionable errors when expectations are not met.

Interaction:
- Can be used by pipelines or APIs to assert expected schemas before transforms.
- Keep checks minimal to preserve flexibility and avoid tight coupling.

Note:
- Current preprocessing functions (transforms/preprocessing.py) tolerate missing/invalid
  values gracefully (return None). Add validation here if strict schema enforcement is needed.
